# CLFE
FORTRAN, C++ Project for Masters course work

1. **Newton90**  - Implementation of Newtons algorithm to scan for roots

2. **MatMult90** - Multiplication of given matrices S = M1xM2x....Mn

3. **ThinWalledApproximation** - The goal of this project is, to compare the result of the thin walled approximation with the exact values
of the profileâ€™s area and moment of inertia.
